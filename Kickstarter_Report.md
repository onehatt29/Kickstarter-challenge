# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 The Kickstarter project was comprised of data from multiple entertainment sources. these sources of data consisted of multiple categories of entertainment from around the world.  The data from these entertainment sources will provide the best option for Louise to fulfill her theater fundraiser.     

### Purpose
The purpose of the Analysis was to help Louise raise capital for her play Fever, An order to help Louise raise capital there needed to be some analytics done on several different play fund rises from around the world. To perform these analyses data needed to be captured from successful, failed, and canceled plays and the capital raised against goals and pledged amounts.  

## Analysis and Challenges
To provide Louise with a suitable option for her Kickstarter campaign the data in the spreadsheet needed to be broken down. One option for Louise was to view the data by theater outcomes by launch date. This provided a visualization of plays that were successful based on their launch date and overall outcomes based on launch dates Here is a description of those.


Based on the First visualization it shows that successful shows are Launched during  May. And failed shows are Launched in October.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the data provided by outcome-based on the launch date the Pivot table and line graph showing the best and harder times of the year to launch a play. The best times to launch based on the data will be May, June, and July. The more difficult months are Sep, Oct, and Nov.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Most of my challenges presented themselves during the outcomes based on the goals section. I was having trouble determining how to calculate the percentage that failed and canceled. Another difficulty I faced was keeping track of what I was doing after working on the Kickstarter file for several days I lost track and didn’t know what to look at to determine the best outcome based on the data.



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The outcomes Based on launch date provides a visualization of the best times to launch.
It displays the months in which it’s advantageous to launch and when it is not based on Month along with the category of successful, canceled, and failed.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
I believe the dataset limit pledged amount based on demographics.
It could benefit Lousie to know who her target demographics should be to rise capital.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
One other possible table that could be added is cities and towns of the country where plays were successful based on the outcome.
